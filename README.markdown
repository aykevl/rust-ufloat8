# ufloat8 library

This is a small library implementing a custom unsigned floating-point-like
integer format using just 8 bits. I wrote it to send a duration (in time) of a
wide range in just one byte, while keeping precision for smaller values.

See [the main repository](https://github.com/aykevl/ufloat8), this is a
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) implementation.
